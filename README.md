REALLY simple project made in a few hours using Avalonia.
I didn't follow a tutorial for this and didn't use any AI either.

I did look at the docs a bit ofc. 
I also looked at the ToDoList tutorial for tiny things but if you compare my project and the tutorial, you can see that I did not copy or follow the tutorial

:)
